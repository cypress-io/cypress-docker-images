This image should be enough to run Cypress tests headlessly or in the interactive mode with a single Docker command like this:

```shell
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:3.3.2
```

If you want to see the [Cypress debug logs](https://on.cypress.io/debugging#Print-DEBUG-logs) during the run, pass environment variable `DEBUG`:

```shell
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e -e DEBUG=cypress:* cypress/included:3.8.1
  cypress:cli:cli cli starts with arguments ["/usr/local/bin/node","/usr/local/bin/cypress","run"] +0ms
  cypress:cli NODE_OPTIONS is not set +0ms
  cypress:cli:cli program parsing arguments +3ms
  ...
```

If you want to use a different browser (assuming it is installed in the container) use:

```shell
$ docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e --entrypoint=cypress cypress/included:3.8.1 run --browser chrome

For more information, read [Run Cypress with a single Docker command](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/02/run-cypress-with-a-single-docker-command/) and [End-to-End Testing Web Apps: The Painless Way](https://mtlynch.io/painless-web-app-testing/)

## Default user

By default, the included images run as `root` user. You can switch the user to the second user in the image `node` or custom-mapped user, see [examples section](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images#examples). Starting with `cypress/included:3.8.1` we set permissions on the globally installed Cypress and set binary cache variable to allow other users read and execute access. Thus you will be able to run Cypress as non-root user by using `-u node`

```shell
$ docker run -it -v $PWD/src:/test -w /test -u node cypress/included:3.8.1
```

## Building and testing

To build a new image, clone an existing folder, update version strings and build the Docker image locally. Then test it by creating a new project and running headless tests. For example:

```shell
cd /tmp
mkdir test
cd test
npm init --yes
npm i -D cypress
npx @bahmutov/cly init
rm -rf package-lock.json package.json node_modules
docker run -it -v $PWD:/e2e -w /e2e cypress/included:3.3.2
```

**Tip:** the above commands are in the file [test.sh](test.sh)

The tests should finish successfully using local image. Now push the image to the Docker hub

```shell
docker push cypress/included:3.3.2
```

## GitHub Action

You can quickly run your tests in GitHub Actions using these images, see [cypress-gh-action-included](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-gh-action-included) repository.

## GitLab CI

You can use the included images to run Cypress tests on GitLab CI, see how in [cypress-example-included](https://gitlab.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-included) repository.
