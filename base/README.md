# cypress/base

Main images that include all operating system dependencies necessary to run Cypress, **but NOT the test runner itself**.

Each tag is in a sub folder, named after Node version or OS it is built on.

Image `cypress/base:8` is tagged [`latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/cypress/base/tags/)

**note** Cypress no longer supports Node v0.12.x. Using 4.x image is not recommended, and we do not plan to release new versions of Cypress tested on Node v4. See [End-of-Life Releases](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#end-of-life-releases).
