# Loosen file priveleges for the cypress cache. The first time that cypress runs it will create a
# binary_state.json file if it hasn't already been created. This was causing issues with non-root
# users, they do not have access to write to this directory. Since this is a develompent docker container
# and to lower barriers as much as possible, we are loosening privs to allow the binary_state.json file
# to be created. Previously this file was created by root when cypress verify was called, but this would
# apply to amd processors since cypress verify was not called on arm processors.
