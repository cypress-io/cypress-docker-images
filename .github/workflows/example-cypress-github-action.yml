name: Example Cypress GitHub Actions
# This example workflow demonstrates
# GitHub Actions (https://docs.github.com/en/actions) using the
# Cypress JavaScript GitHub Action (https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action) with
# Cypress Docker images (https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images)

# The workflow is triggered manually on demand, see
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/manually-running-a-workflow
# To automatically trigger a workflow, for instance on a push event, see
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/triggering-a-workflow
